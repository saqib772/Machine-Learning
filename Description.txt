This Project will be reading two CSV files containing data on confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19, respectively, and then performing some data preparation, visualization, and analysis on the data.

The data preparation steps include:

Creating a new DataFrame called world with two columns: "Country" and "cases"
Populating the "Country" column with the column names (countries) from the confirmed cases data
Calculating the total number of confirmed cases for each country and storing the results in the "cases" column
Cleaning up the country names by removing any dots or parentheses
Reading in a CSV file called "continents2.csv" and storing it in a DataFrame called continent
Converting the "name" column in the continent DataFrame to uppercase
Creating a new column in the world DataFrame called "Cases Range" and assigning to each row in this column a categorical value based on the corresponding value in the "cases" column
Creating a new column in the world DataFrame called "Alpha3" and storing the "alpha-3" value for each country from the continent DataFrame
The code then generates a choropleth map of the world showing the spread of COVID-19 cases by country, using the Plotly Express library.

Next, the code generates two line plots showing the daily number of confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 over time. The plots also show the 5-day moving average of the data.
